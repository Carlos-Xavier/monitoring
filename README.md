# monitoring

This code implements a program that performs real-time recording and displays a control panel with information about the number of recorded images. The main goal is to assist in cat detection.

The program allows the user to enter an IP address of a surveillance camera to perform the recording. Then, the program generates a dynamic bar chart that displays the quantity of recorded images at regular intervals.
